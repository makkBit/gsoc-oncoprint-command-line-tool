Make node.js command-line tool out of oncoprint.js library


##### Project title
Make node.js command-line tool out of oncoprint.js library

##### Description
The goal is to use the existing oncoprint library, and the node.js javascript environment, to create a fully-featured command line tool which allows users to pass in their data (format TBD), pass in configuration parameters of how they'd like the oncoprint to look, and receive an oncoprint in SVG format.
